# DCGAN_portrait_img
Implemented a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate artistic images by training it on a dataset of portrait images. The aim was to create a model capable of producing unique and visually compelling artworks by learning the intricate features and patterns present in artistic portraits.


Here are some examples illustrating the progression of images generated by a DC GAN over the course of 100 epochs.

The loss of both the discriminator and the generator is also plotted.
