# DCGAN_portrait_img
Implemented a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate artistic images by training it on a dataset of portrait images. The aim was to create a model capable of producing unique and visually compelling artworks by learning the intricate features and patterns present in artistic portraits.
